            Hi, my name is Dayle Klinkhamer. I am an aspiring Software Engineer,looking to use my skills in tech to really
            make a difference. I have been using a computer since I can remember and technology has always been a major focus for me.
            I took an interest early on into learning all different things I could do on a computer.I have been self taught all the
            way, teaching myself how to set up servers for games I played growing up and learning whatever else was neccesary to do the
            things I wanted to do. Learning new things has never been an obstacle for me but rather it is something I enjoy doing. 
            I love learning so much, I actually consider it to be a hobby of mine. As long as I live I will continue to learn, constantly
            on the hunt for new documentaries to watch and new topics to master. One of my favourite topics would have to be history.
            I think video games, despite their poor reputation which is thankfully changing, have a lot to teach people, I for one feel
            I learnt alot of skills from video games such as problem solving, logical and critical thinking and the ability to multi task
            in a way that allows me to keep many things in mind at once.

            <h3 id="educationHeading">Education</h3>
            <p id="educationP"> I finished matric top of my school, however I never enjoyed school. I love learning but school never felt like it was conducive
                to learning for me so traditional further schooling was not for me. I decided to follow my passion for tech by going to the weThinkCode
                coding bootcamp and later the HyperionDev Software Engineering bootcamp. I also did alot of self teaching between these two bootcamps.

                <h2 id="projectsHeading">Projects I have done</h2>
                <p id="projectsP"><br><br> Made a Construction Project Management System with a MySQL Database in Java for a HyperionDev Project.
                    It has two menus, one related to all projects, eg adding projects, adding project architects and contractors
                    and displaying them. The other menu is for a selected project, allowing you to edit details about it. It does
                    all this through a MySQL database server.<br>
                <br>
                Made a Task Management System in Python very similar to the Construction Managment Project in java<br>
                <br>
                Made a basic game with pygame in Python where you play as a Pac-Man character trying to collect fruit
                while avoiding the ghost enemies.<br>
                <br>
                Made a Financial Calculator in Python that allows you to choose from two different calculators,
                one will work out a monthly bond repayment and the other will work out the interest earned from
                a bank account.
